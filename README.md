# HANGMAN
A mini project that I made using Python that simulates the game Hangman.
In this game, you guess a car brand that is randomly generated. You can either guess the word one character at a time or you can guess the entire word. Each time the user guesses wrong, a part of the hangman is drawn until it is complete. You have 5 tries. 
I have attached the csv file of the car brands and the source code.
Good luck!
